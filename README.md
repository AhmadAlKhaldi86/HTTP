# Security


#### General
- Encoding: Is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content.

- Hashing: Ensuring integrity. Hashing takes arbitrary input and produce a fixed-length string.

- Eyncription: Encryption transforms data into another format in such a way that only specific individual(s) can read it. 
  - a ciphertext, algorithm, and key are all required to return to the plaintext.
